# Data-centric Development Milestone Project – 'Banarama' Photo Album
___

### Context
This project focuses on the data-centric development for a mobile-responsive web-based photo album application called ‘Banarama’. From the get-go, users can create albums, upload their photos on this application and then share their albums with anyone. 

The application does not require users to create an account. Users can choose to upload their photos into a default album called ‘Uploads’ or create their own albums.

### Demo
A live website of the application can be found here: https://tsw-photogallery.herokuapp.com/

#### (iii) Design
As the name of the web application suggests, 'Banarama', the colour palette and general design of the website takes after the colours of a banana (i.e. yellow, brown, black and green). As the focus of the project is a data-centric one, the layout of the webpage is not overly complex. Animated gifs were added to the website to enhance the visual experience of users.
